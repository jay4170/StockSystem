# Project Title

A simple stock system designed in Java whilst studying Computer Science. 

## Description
A shop stock system with advanced sorting and printing functionality has been implemented. In order to meet the stipulation of not using any collections or libraries, custom data structures, such as a linked list, have been created. Quicksort algorithm has been implemented for efficient sorting of the stock. To ensure the correctness of the implementation, a set of self-made test cases have been included in the program, as the use of testing libraries was prohibited
