# Stock System

A simple stock system designed in Java, built as part of a Computer Science course. The system allows a shop to keep track of their stock and provides advanced sorting and printing functionality.

## Features

- Custom data structures such as a linked list to store and manage stock items
- Implementation of Quicksort algorithm for efficient stock sorting
- Self-made test cases to validate the accuracy of the system
- Vanilla Java implementation, without the use of collections or libraries
- Self-made test cases have been included in the program, as the use of testing libraries was prohibited
- In order to meet the stipulation of not using any collections or libraries, custom data structures, such as a linked list, have been created.
